"""The `stable` channel is a rule, so it is executed rather than read.

`latest` moves on every release, majors included. A deployment that pulls by
tag is therefore dragged across a breaking change by a tag whose name promises
the opposite, with no operator decision in between. `stable` exists to be the
tag that does not do that: it advances on a minor or a patch and stops at a
major until someone promotes it deliberately.

That rule lives in a shell block inside `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which
runs only on a tag push. A rule that executes a handful of times a year, in an
environment nobody can step through, is a rule that rots. So this test lifts
that exact block out of the workflow and runs it under bash with each
combination of inputs. It does not re-implement the logic: a copy would agree
with itself while the workflow drifted.
