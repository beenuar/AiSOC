"""
REST API for the generic live-action interface (Stage 2 #8).

Three endpoints:

  ``GET  /api/v1/live-actions``
      Discovery. Returns every registered ``(vendor_id, capability)``
      pair plus its descriptor so the agent loop, the playbook editor,
      and the frontend can build action menus without hard-coding the
      vendor list.

  ``POST /api/v1/live-actions/dispatch``
      Synchronous dispatch. Looks up the executor for
      ``(vendor_id, capability)`` and runs it. ``dry_run=true`` strips
      credentials and the executor falls through to its simulation
      branch — see ``app.live_actions.builtins`` for the contract.

  ``POST /api/v1/live-actions/dry-run``
      Convenience wrapper that forces ``dry_run=true`` so frontends
      can render a "preview what this would do" button without having
      to know about the dry_run field. Internally identical to
      ``/dispatch``.

The router never raises HTTPException for executor-level failures —
those return ``LiveActionResult`` with ``status=failed`` so callers
have a uniform contract. ``HTTPException`` is reserved for genuinely
malformed requests (which Pydantic catches first anyway).
