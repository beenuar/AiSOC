# AiSOC depth plan, wave 2: progress

Mirrors `plans/aisoc_depth_wave2.plan.md`, which is locked and is the source of
truth. This file is the mutable half. The only permitted edit to the plan file
is flipping a todo's `status` in its front matter; every deviation is recorded
here.

Legend: `[ ]` not started, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` done, `[!]` blocked (with
exactly what is needed).

An item is `[x]` only when all three of these are recorded against it: the test
or gate that failed on the pre-change tree for the stated reason, the change,
and the negative control showing that reverting it fails again.

- **Base commit:** `152c6d5f` (`origin/main`, v21.0.0).
- **Plan captured at:** `152c6d5`. Figures in the plan body are hints at that
  commit; Phase 0.2 below re-derives each one and the tree wins.
- **Predecessor:** `DEPTH_PROGRESS.md` tracks the first depth plan. Items that
  plan left open are carried here (see "Hand-over" below) and are never ticked
  in both files.

## Hand-over from the first depth plan

Recorded once, at kickoff, as the plan's precondition requires. These items
move from `plans/aisoc_depth_plan.plan.md` to this plan and are tracked here
from now on; `DEPTH_PROGRESS.md` gains a cross-reference rather than a tick.

| First depth plan item | Carried to | Note at hand-over |
|---|---|---|
| 0.3 `make up-full` baseline | wave 2 Phase 0.3 | `DEPTH_PROGRESS.md` D2 records why it was not captured there |
| 2.6 effective permissions | wave 2 Phase 1.1 | wave 2 adds usage overlay, computed tags, AWS semantics |
| 3.6 content depth | wave 2 Phase 2.1 | wave 2 adds the scenario families |
| 3.7 detection engineering agent | wave 2 Phase 2.5 | unchanged scope |
| 4.4 cloud-hardware run | wave 2 Phase 8.4 | maintainer-blocked at hand-over |
| 4.5 managed-cluster run | wave 2 Phase 8.4 | maintainer-blocked at hand-over |
| 5.5 verb breadth | wave 2 Phase 6.1 | wave 2 raises the floor to 150 arms |
| 5.6 plain-language playbooks | wave 2 Phase 6.2 | wave 2 adds the bounded model step |
| 6.3–6.6 AI estate | wave 2 Phases 7.1, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 | wave 2 adds hosted agents and repo skills (7.2) |
| 8.1 sub-item 4.5 operator pages | wave 2 Phase 9.5 | unchanged scope |
| 8.1 sub-item 4.6 internationalisation | wave 2 Phase 9.3 | unchanged scope |
| 9.4 Teams half | wave 2 Phase 9.4 | maintainer-blocked at hand-over |
| 9.6 remainder (device evidence) | wave 2 Phase 9.2 | maintainer-blocked at hand-over |
| Phase 10 close | wave 2 Phase 10 | wave 2's Phase 10 closes both |

## Migration and ADR numbers claimed

Claim a number here, push the claim, then write the file. Two lanes once
claimed the same migration number simultaneously and one had to renumber.

| Number | Kind | Lane / item | Claimed | File |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0015 | ADR | Wave 0 / Phase 0.4 | 2026-11-01 | `docs/decisions/0015-siem-replacement-scope.md` |
| 142 | migration | Lane D / Phase 6.3 | 2026-11-01 | tenant response schedule (business hours, on-call) |
| 143 | migration | Lane D / Phase 6.3 | 2026-11-01 | approval timeout outcomes on the durable pause |
| 144 | migration | Lane D / Phase 6.4 | 2026-11-01 | reserved — ticket-sync state, if 6.4 reproduces a gap |
| 145 | migration | Lane D / Phase 7.5 | 2026-11-01 | reserved — AI containment state, if needed |
| 0020 | ADR | Lane D | 2026-11-01 | reserved |

Highest at kickoff: migration `123`, ADR `0014`. Next free: migration `124`,
ADR `0016`.

Pre-allocated exclusive blocks, claimed at lane start so two lanes cannot pick
the same number: Lane D holds migrations **142–145** and ADR **0020**. A
reserved number that is not used is released by striking it here at lane
close, never by a second lane assuming it is free.

## Phase 0: Kickoff

- [x] **0.1** This file exists, modelled on `DEPTH_PROGRESS.md`, with the
      hand-over recorded above.
- [x] **0.2** Every figure re-derived against the base commit. See below.
- [x] **0.3** Baseline artefacts committed under
      `docs/audit/depth2-baseline/` with hardware, date and commit.
- [x] **0.4** ADR-0015 (SIEM-replacement scope) written as **proposed**:
      AiSOC federates to the SIEM rather than replacing it, so the README's
      "Not a drop-in SIEM replacement" is now a decided position with its
      cost argument recorded. Nothing is built from it in this plan.

### 0.2 Re-derived figures

(arm64, macOS), from the generators the plan names. Captured values are the
plan body's; measured values are this tree's. The tree wins.

Every figure the plan named reproduces exactly except the last, which the plan
itself flagged as approximate ("about 358 ... record why it moved").

### D1 — The cloud/identity/SaaS/code condition count has no formal rule yet

The first depth plan's 3.6 counts "executable cloud, identity, SaaS and code
conditions (native rules, windowed rules and threat-and-anomaly conditions
together)", by `log_source` product. No script in the tree implements that
sentence, so every published value of it — 461 at the first plan's capture,
395 at its re-derivation, "about 358" in this plan — was counted by hand with
a slightly different product set. That is the defect this plan's Phase 2.1
fixes by requiring a `make stats` line held by a `--check` gate.

Measured here, stating the method so the next reader can reproduce it: native
compiled rules whose `product` falls in the cloud (`aws`, `gcp`, `azure`,
`kubernetes`, `docker`, `cloudflare`), identity (`okta`, `identity`,
`active-directory`, `entra`, `auth0`, `jumpcloud`, `ping`, `onelogin`, `duo`),
SaaS (`google-workspace`, `m365`, `slack`, `salesforce`, `snowflake`, `box`,
`dropbox`, `1password`, `atlassian`, `jira`, `confluence`, `zoom`,
`servicenow`, `notion`, `hubspot`) and code (`github`, `gitlab`, `bitbucket`,
`npm`, `pypi`) sets: **344**.

Top contributors: `aws` 73, `azure` 46, `kubernetes` 37, `gcp` 35, `okta` 33,
`identity` 33, `active-directory` 17, `google-workspace` 10, `docker` 9,
`m365` 8, `github` 7, `slack` 7.

Windowed rules contribute **0** to that figure, and the reason is a finding in
itself: `windowed_ruleset.json` entries carry `category` but **no `product`
field at all**, so a product-keyed count cannot see them and a category-keyed
count would be counting a different thing. Phase 2.1's gate has to decide this
explicitly — either windowed rules gain a product, or the published figure
says "native only" — and whichever it picks, the number moves again. Recorded
here so that move reads as a definition being fixed rather than as content
disappearing.

The gap between 344 and "about 358" is therefore a difference of product sets,
not of content: nothing was removed from the tree between the plan's capture
commit and this one (they are the same commit, `152c6d5`).

### 0.3 Baseline artefacts

Committed under `docs/audit/depth2-baseline/` with hardware, date and commit
on each. These are the "before" for every later delta.

| Artefact | Status |
|---|---|
| Re-derived figures | captured (the table above) |
| Executor arm count | captured (89 strict / 39 verbs / 111 loose) |
| Cloud/identity/SaaS/code conditions | captured (344, method recorded in D1) |
| Verdict scorecard | the published matrix is the baseline; re-running it needs a local model pulled (see below) |
| Alert-reduction suite | captured |
| `make up` + `make smoke` | captured |
| `make up-full` | captured — closes the first depth plan's D2 |

## Deviations

Recorded as they are found. D1 is above.

### D2 — `make up-full` failed its first run on a port bind, and what that does and does not prove

The baseline host had nine unrelated containers running from other projects,
one of them `lodestone-postgres-1` published on `0.0.0.0:5432`. That is the
exact condition the port resolver was built for, and it is a more honest
baseline host than a clean one.

What happened, in order:

1. `make up` succeeded. CORE came up, an administrator was created, and
   `make smoke` passed 10 of 10 stages. No `docker-compose.ports.yml` was
   written during this run.
2. `make up-full` recreated `postgres` (the `full` profile changes its
   environment) and the recreate failed:
   `Bind for 0.0.0.0:5432 failed: port is already allocated`.
3. Running `python3 scripts/resolve_port_conflicts.py` by hand detected the
   conflict immediately and wrote the overlay:
   `postgres 5432 → 15432 (5432 is held by container lodestone-postgres-1)`.
4. `make up-full` then succeeded: 22 AiSOC containers, postgres published on
   15432.

Both `up` and `up-full` declare `_ports` as a prerequisite, and `COMPOSE` is
a recursively-expanded variable whose `$(shell test -f ...)` re-runs on every
reference, so the overlay is picked up by both targets once it exists. The
unexplained step is (1): the resolver ran as a prerequisite of `make up` and
did not write an overlay, while the same script three minutes later did.

**What this does not prove.** Step 1 ran against a tree where an earlier
backgrounded `make up` had been killed mid-pull, so the container and
network state at that moment is not reconstructable, and the two obvious
hypotheses — a probe that reads a held port as free (the `SO_REUSEADDR`
class, recorded as fixed) versus a resolver that correctly saw AiSOC's own
already-running postgres — cannot be separated from this evidence. A grep is
not a reproduction and neither is a sequence I cannot replay.

**Carried as a follow-up, not claimed as a defect:** reproduce on a clean
host by starting a foreign Postgres on 5432 first, then `make up` from a tree
with no overlay present, and record whether the overlay is written. If it is
not, that is a real first-run defect for the most common conflict there is
and belongs in its own fix with a negative control. Until that run exists,
this is an observation with its evidence attached.
